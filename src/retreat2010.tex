    \emph{Introduction}
    One method to obtain optical sectioned data is “structured
    illumination microscopy” (SIM), as implemented in commercial
    devices like the Zeiss ApoTome or the Qioptiq Optigrid. In this
    procedure, a grating is inserted in the illumination path of a
    conventional fluorescence microscope and projected into sample
    space (Fig.1). Taking three images with three different grating
    positions (Fig.2) allows one to computationally remove
    out-of-focus light. As a result, contrast and resolution in
    z-direction are improved (Fig.3).

    \emph{The principle} Fig.4 shows the effect of the grating on the
    detected fluorophore intensity. Depending on their z-position the
    moving of the grating will lead to an intensity modulation. This
    fact is essential to computationally remove out-of-focus light.

    \emph{SIM reconstruction} Different algorithms can be used to
    remove out-of-focus light. A very simple one is explained in
    Fig.5.


    Figure 1. The grating is inserted at the field diaphragm in the
    illumination path of a conventional fluorescence microscope and
    projected onto the sample using an incoherent light source.

    Figure 2. Shown are the three raw images, each with a different
    grating position. The same grid line is marked with a red bar in
    each image. After the first image is taken, the grating is moved
    linearly by 1/3 of the grating period length to capture the second
    image, and another 1/3 to capture the third image. Specimen: Adult
    rat cardiomyocytes, stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies
    against the titin epitope T12 and secondary Cy2-conjugated anti
    mouse immunoglobulin antibodies.

    Figure 3. Shown are two images of adult rat cardiomyocytes stained
    with monoclonal mouse antibodies against the titin epitope T12 and
    secondary Cy2-conjugated anti mouse immunoglobulin
    antibodies. Left: widefield, Right: SIM reconstruction.

    Figure 4. Simulation of a x-z cross section through sample space
    showing the three raw images taken at different grating positions
    and the effect on the detected intensity of the fluorophores I and
    II. The moving of the grating leads to an intensity modulation for
    fluorophore I in but not for fluorophore II.


    Figure 5. Max-Min - Algorithm for the situation shown in
    Fig. 4. Every pixel value consists of modulated in-focus
    information (II1, II2, II3) and unmodulated out-of-focus
    information (III). The lowest of the three values that were taken
    for each pixel Imin is substracted from the highest of the three
    pixel values Imax. The final image I contains exclusively in-focus
    information. The unmodulated out-of-focus information III has been
    removed.

  In some biological specimen it is possible to exploit a sparse
  fluorophore concentration. In our modified wide field microscope we
  can shape the light distribution of the excitation light in the
  front and back focal plane. This facilitates excitation of in-focus
  fluorophores without or with much reduced exposure of out-of-focus
  fluorophores. The benefits will be twofold: A smaller out-of-focus
  blur reduces its contribution to the photon noise and therefore
  improves the signal noise ratio in the image. Reducing unnecessary
  exposure also protects the specimen. This can be important when
  observing development of embryos.

  In order to use of the light shaping to our advantage it is
  necessary to account for the fluorophore concentration in the
  specimen. We represent the specimen (c. elegans embryo) as a
  sufficiently accurate model (each nucleus is represented as a
  sphere).  By raytracing it is then possible to find "empty" regions
  in the back focal plane. Limiting the illumination to these regions
  will excite one nucleus in the focal plane and protect all the
  nuclei from exposure.

  Figure *** 1 middle and right *** shows a model of an immersion
  objective and the path of excitation rays from the back focal plane
  towards the sample. The sample is a plane of spheres with one sphere
  moved down. The excitation rays fill the biggest possible circle in
  the back focal plane, so that they illuminate the single sphere
  without crossing the other spheres. In Figure *** 1 left *** the the
  average intersection length of the rays with the out-of-focus
  spheres is plotted. A circular window with relative radius r
  (compared to back focal plane radius) is scanned over the back focal
  plane. In black regions the rays don't hit any out-of-focus
  spheres. In order to find an optimal illumination shape the window
  radius is increased until the value in the minimum starts to
  increase.

  Figure *** 2 *** displays the same plot for a nucleus in the
  periphery of a c. elegans embryo.

  Raytracing model of a test sample containing an out-of-focus plane
  of spheres and one target sphere below. The circular shapes on the
  left depict an estimate of out-of-focus exposure for different
  window sizes in the back focal plane.
